title: 'No "Open Source" Trademark'

- [OSI Announcement of "OSI Certified" mark and inability to trademark "open source"](https://opensource.org/pressreleases/certified-open-source.php)

  > That's not likely, for the very reason the application was permitted to lapse. We have discovered that there is virtually no chance that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would register the mark "open source"; the mark is too descriptive. Ironically, we were partly a victim of our own success in bringing the "open source" concept into the mainstream.

   > Benefits of an Open Technology Model
   >
   > Caldera believes an open source code model benefits the industry in
   > many ways.
   > This model:
   >   * Increases competition, which historically leads to higher-quality
   >     and lower-cost products.
   >   * Decreases the time-to-market of innovative software.
   >   * Facilitates creation of customized solutions by developers,
   >     Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Value Added Resellers
   >     (VARs) for even the most highly-specialized computing
   >     environments.
   >   * Extends market implementation of mature, proven technologies
   >     historically de-emphasized by major software vendors who favor
   >     new, resource-intensive technologies. Empowers independent
   >     developers to influence future technology advancements.
   >   * Creates a large pool of individuals with broad knowledge of DOS,
   >     increasing availability of technical support and consulting for
   >     end users, historically at a lower cost and with quicker response
   >     time.
