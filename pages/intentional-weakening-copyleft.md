- Linux Syscall Note

  > NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
  > services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
  > of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
  > Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
  > Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the Linux
  > kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.
  >
  > Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
  > is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
  > v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

  > extend this exception to your version of the code, but you are not obligated
  > to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from
  > your version.
