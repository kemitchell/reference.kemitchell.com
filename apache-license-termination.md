> Since it looks like the patent termination

> usurped into a closed-source derivative by a 
> non-contributing patent holder.

> Since the majority of ASF contributions are

> At HP there is one set of open source licenses that gets more critical
> pushback than any other, and the GPL is not in that set. It is the IBM
> Public License (and its cousin the Common PL) and the Mozilla Public
> License 1.1 (and its cousin NPL 1.1). That heightened scrutiny is due to
> a single sentence -- a sentence which is now proposed to be added to the
> Apache license as the first sentence of section 5:
> 
> "If You institute patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
> to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
> counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
> Contributor to You under this License shall terminate as of the date
> such litigation is filed."
> 
> Because the trigger of this termination is unrelated to the software
> being licensed, (in contrast to the second sentence of section 5) there
> is no good way to manage that termination risk. The addition of that
> sentence would require an entirely new perspective on use of software
> under the Apache license. Further, companies that consider incorporating
> software under this license into a product that they will redistribute
> will need to convince their customers that using software with this sort
> of licensing contingency is a risk that the customer ought to take.
> 
> >From the list of goals, it appears that there may be belief that this
> section somehow addresses goal 5: "It would be nice to have some
> language in the license that protected us from patent-infringement
> suits, at the very least from contributors if not in more general ways.
> Solved in 2.0."
> 
> For any "us" that does not own a patent that applies to software
> licensed under the Apache license, section 5 provides no benefit
> whatsoever. The benefit provided by section 5 is a benefit that only
> applies to patent owners: if you don't have a patent (in particular, if
> you don't have a patent that applies to the Apache-licensed software),
> then you aren't granting any license that is terminated by section 5;
> section 5 gives you neither leverage nor other benefit. 
> 
> The first sentence of section 5 should be struck. It seriously burdens
> the usability of software under the Apache license; and it does so
> without advancing the goals of the ASF.
